This directory contains code to preprocess the raw table-to-text datasets into our text-to-table datasets.

Run `preprocess_xxx.sh` to preprocess each raw dataset. Raw datasets will be downloaded to `raw/` and preprocessed datasets will be in `preprocessed`.

You can also directly download our preprocessed dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zTfDFCl1nf_giX7IniY5WbXi9tAuEHDn/view?usp=sharing).
